This folder contains the population maps:

1. popmap_complete.tsv - including all individuals (3 species).
2. popmap_subterranea.tsv - including only Stygocapitella subterranea
3. popmap_josemariobrancoi.tsv - including only Stygocapitella josemariobrancoi
4. popmap_westheidei.tsv - including only Stygocapitella westheidei
5. popmap_cleaned.tsv - including individuals from the three species, but after cleaning. See the document ../01_stacks for cleaning.

Notice that the structure of population maps may have been corrupted as I copied them to github. Population maps should consist of two columns, separated by a tab:
<sample_01><tab><population_or_species_A>
<sample_02><tab><population_or_species_A>
<sample_03><tab><population_or_species_B>
<sample_04><tab><population_or_species_B>
